## Philosophy of AI

* [Superintelligence](http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Non-fiction/Superintelligence-Audiobook/B00LPMA33G) - Superintelligence asks the questions: What happens when machines surpass humans in general intelligence. A really great book. 
* [Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era](http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Non-fiction/Our-Final-Invention-Audiobook/B00KLJMDH8) - Our Final Invention explores the perils of the heedless pursuit of advanced AI. Until now, human intelligence has had no rival. Can we coexist with beings whose intelligence dwarfs our own? And will they allow us to?
* [How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed](http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/How-to-Create-a-Mind-Audiobook/B009S7OKJS/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1422483493&sr=1-1) - Ray Kurzweil, director of engineering at Google, explored the process of reverse-engineering the brain to understand precisely how it works, then applies that knowledge to create vastly intelligent machines.
* [On Intelligence](http://www.amazon.in/Intelligence-Jeff-Hawkins/dp/0805078533) - Jeff Hawkins, develops a powerful theory of how the human brain works, explaining why computers are not intelligent and how, based on this new theory, we can finally build intelligent machines.
