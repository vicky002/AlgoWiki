Resources For Learning Nodejs
==================================

## What is Nodejs?
----------------

Nodejs is an open source javascript framework for building scalable server-side applications.
Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

## Where to use Nodejs?
---------------------

 Node.js is best suited for real-time applications: online games, collaboration tools, chat rooms, or anything where what one user (or robot? or sensor?) does with the application needs to be seen by other users immediately, without a page refresh.

 ## Advantages of using Nodejs over other frameworks
 -------------------------------------------------
 + Node.js encourages sharing with the presence of the Node Package Manager or NPM. It includes the repository of 50,000 packages, which helps developers to create effective solutions. With the inbuilt NPM, developers can update, share or reuse codes with utmost ease. Therefore, it can be stated that Node.js package manager is robust and a consistent solution for developers.

 + Node.js has extraordinary features when it comes to developing real-time applications such as chats and gaming apps. It is also a good fit for the programs that need event-based server, as well as non-blocking driven servers. It is worth mentioning that renowned platforms such as PayPal, eBay, LinkedIn, etc. have all been developed using Node.js.

 + Node.js uses the V8 engine developed by Google which compiles JavaScript into native machine code and runs at lightning speed. Node.js does not jumble up with creating separate threads involving locking headache but it rather has single thread i.e. the event loop which is responsible for all the asynchronous I/O operations.
